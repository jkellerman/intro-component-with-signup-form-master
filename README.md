## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say _"[Field Name] cannot be empty"_
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say _"Looks like this is not an email"_

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- ES6 Javascript

### What I learned

I learned how to customise form validations using JavaScript. Some of the key takeaways from this project was how to access input placeholder in the DOM and using JavaScript to change styling of elements.

### Continued development

Something i'd like to continue developing in relation to form validations is setting conditions for input lengths and password requirements such as including numbers and symbols.
